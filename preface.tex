\chapter{Preface}
This document is created purely from personal interest in mathematics and
programming. I have no background in medicine nor in social sciences
whatsoever, and everything I present may be commonly known for the people
having expertise on those fields. Document does not fulfill the requirements
of scientific publication, and it is certainly not peer-reviewed, and is
evolving over time. Therefore, the information should be considered more or
less unreliable, and you should use your own judgement to evaluate if it is
accurate or not. 

Regardless of it's
severity, COVID19 offers a great opportunity to apply mathematics and control
theory to societal problems.This work is personal effort to understand `the
truth', he laws behind the societal (control) systems, their responses and
their stability.  It may also reveal discrepancies between the reality and the
executed political actions. Ability to identify them I consider very important
during the times we are living.
